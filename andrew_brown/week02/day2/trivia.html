      </br><li>She has dozens of various places, objects and organisations named after her.</li></br>

      <li>These include the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Hopper, the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at  NERSC and the Department of Energy's flagship computer system "Hopper".</li></br>

      <li>At the age of seven she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked, and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realised what she was doing.</li></br>

      <li>Owing to the breadth of her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to as Amazing Grace.</li></br>

      <li>Women at the world's largest software company, Microsoft, formed an employee group called Hoppers and established a scholarship in her honor.</li></br>

      <li>Hopper is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches.</li></br>

      <li>While she was working on a computer in 1947, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a  relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were "debugging" the system.</li></br>

      <li>In front of the River House Apartments, the park was originally funded by private sources, but in later years, it became an official park of Arlington County.</li></br>

      <li>One of Hopper's most famous quotes, which is often attributed to others, is: "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."</li></br>
