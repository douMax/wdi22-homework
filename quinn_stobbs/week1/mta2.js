//PART 1

// // console.log() shows output similar to this:
// // "You must travel through the following stops on the N line: 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square."

            // console.log ('N', '34th', Union Square) - successful travel through the N line


// * Work out how you would do it on paper first! Then start to explain that process in Javascript.
// * Get the program to work for a single line before trying to tackle multiple lines.
// * The key to the lab is finding the index positions of each stop. (hint: ```indexOf()```)
// * Don't worry about prompting the user for input. Hard code some values to get it working.

//   * The N line has the following stops: Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th

//GOAL
// console.log ('N', '34th', Union Square) - successful travel through the N line

// OTHER PEOPLE
// MAX - using different single line trips
// Max if you the star & end line were the same as the satrt

//key you are running two different single line trips. they will always intersect at union square.
// logggin the first and second line trips
// remember start functions by defining the variables and then set out what you are going to be using. even if they are empty. you will be filliing these later.
// save the array that is associated with the array
// the object was a way to
// you will eventually have a journey to stay in
// slice will include the sub array but not the last value you have to +1 in whatevery you are returning

//slice insists that the first is smaller than the second.
// you chain methods onto each other in order to get your value

//don't worry about storing an empty variable if your function is just going to return right away

// the simplest part is getting the single line trip together

// the function has to be a black box of what you have to put in order to get things out.
// comes down to how the data is being access.


// REETA - for loops
// setting the program to automatically find the name of the line
// tips slice can replace the for loops
