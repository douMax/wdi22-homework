    <p>Lovelace died at the age of 36 - the same age that her father died - on 27 November 1852, from uterine cancer probably exacerbated by bloodletting by her physicians. The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over who Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother's influence, she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor. She lost contact with her husband after she confessed something to him on 20 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. What she told him is unknown. She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsely Towers.</p>

    <p>Despite passing away at a young age, she was able to accomplish more in her short lifetime. Most of her accomplishments were not recognised during her time but only after more than a hundred years from her death.</p>
