    Norbert Wiener
    Claude Shannon
    Grace Hopper
    H. Marshall Mcluhan

Requirements

    At least 3 pages (example: biography, trivia, hometown)
    At least 1 Google Font
    Whatever HTML and CSS you desire
    Keep your code clean and DRY
    Start working with semantic elements: http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/
    No Javascript! Even if you know how to use jQuery, see how far you can push this with pure HTML + CSS
    Don't worry about responsiveness -- desktop resolution is fine

Your research should aim to reveal at least two things about each person:

    Why I admire them
    Something that I probably don't already know about them

Optional extras

    Experiment with custom fonts, Font Awesome, Google Fonts etc.
    Look into CSS3 animations
    Try embedding media (YouTube or Vimeo video, Soundcloud, podcasts)
    Try embedding a Google map (for their hometown and/or alma mater)
