<p class="heading">Sophie Wilson</p>

<p>In the BBC television drama Micro Men, a young version of her was played by Stefan Butler and Wilson herself made a cameo appearance as a pub landlady.</p>

<p>In an Easter break from university, Wilson designed a microcomputer with a 6502 microprocessor inspired by the earlier MK14, which was used to electronically control feed for cows.</p>
