      <li>He enjoyed off-color Yiddish humor</li>
      <li>A close friend, and fellow mathematician, once noted von Neumann would often sleep on an unsolved problem only to awaken with the solution!</li>
      <li>He wrote the first incomplete draft of EDVAC, which was prematurely distributed, and described a computer architecture in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer's memory in the same address space!</li>
